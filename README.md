# Project Name
### Android Basic Stock Application

## Description
This project is based on challenge in Android Basic Compose course unit 3. You can find the link **[here](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-30-days?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcourses%2Fpathways%2Fandroid-basics-compose-unit-3-pathway-3%23codelab-https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcodelabs%2Fbasic-android-kotlin-compose-30-days#1)**.<br>
So, instead of using days as list, I used Indonesia IDX30 stock list. You can find the reference **[here](https://www.cnbcindonesia.com/market/20240126111726-17-509215/simak-daftar-terbaru-emiten-penghuni-idx30-lq45-idx80)**.<br>
